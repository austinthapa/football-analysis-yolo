# Football Analysis Using YOLO

## Description
This project presents a modular, end-to-end computer vision pipeline for analyzing football videos using YOLOv11, OpenCV, and advanced tracking algorithms. The system performs player detection, assigns team identities using jersey color clustering, estimates player speed and distance, and maps player movements onto a static top-down view of the football field through perspective transformation. It produces processed output videos with rich visualizations, enabling insights into match dynamics, all built in a clean, well-defined structure

##  Features

-  **Object Detection**: Uses fine-tuned YOLOv11 to detect players, referees, and the ball.
-  **Tracking**: Assigns consistent IDs across frames using supervised trackers.
-  **Team Identification**: Uses k-means clustering to auto-assign players to teams based on jersey colors.
-  **Perspective Transform**: Converts the dynamic camera view to a static top-down view.
-  **Player Metrics**: Calculates real-time speed, distance, and movement patterns.
-  **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated using mAP@0.5 and mAP@0.5:0.95 metrics.

##  Results

*  High accuracy in player detection and tracking.
*  Real-time distance and speed metrics rendered on the video.
*  Challenges with detecting the ball due to motion blur and occlusion.
*  Limitations with memory on non-GPU devices.

---


##  Limitations

*  Limited real-time capability on non-GPU machines.
*  Ball detection is less reliable.
*  Model performance constrained by dataset quality and size.

##  Future Directions

* Improve ball tracking with interpolation techniques.
* Extend to real-time live-stream processing.
* Add tactical heatmap generation and pass-mapping.
